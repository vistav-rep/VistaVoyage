    fullDescription: "This is the definitive ultra-luxury Kenya safari — crafted for travellers who expect excellence at every turn. Begin with a soft landing at Hemingways Nairobi, then fly to Angama Amboseli, where snowcapped Kilimanjaro frames vast elephant herds and Angama's signature design sets the tone.\n\nContinue to the Masai Mara for three nights at Mara Plains or Mara Nyika — two of the Mara ecosystem's most exclusive conservancy lodges, renowned for big cats, few vehicles, and extraordinary guiding.\n\nRewilded landscapes, night skies, and raw beauty — to restore the soul.\n\nConclude in Laikipia at &Beyond Suyian Lodge, a private conservancy retreat where rewilded landscapes and raw beauty restore the soul. All connections are fly-in, activities are shared with private arrangements on request, and Ongeri's concierge smooths every step.\n\nWhy we love this journey — this is not a compromise itinerary. Every lodge on this circuit sits at the very top of its category. We recommend this safari to guests who have done Kenya before and want to do it properly — or to those who want to start at the top and never look back.",
